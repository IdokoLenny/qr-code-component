## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Media queries

### What I learned

At the end of this challenge, i learned media queries and responsive web design. Always open to any comments or feedbacks.

```css
.container {
  width: 90%;
  margin: auto;
  padding-top: 80px;
  background-color: var(--cl-lg);
  height: 550px;
}

.wbody {
  width: 20%;
  background-color: var(--cl-white);
  padding: 10px;
  margin: auto;
  border-radius: 10px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I would love to make my own QR code generator. so this could be as a default template. i could use the QR code to connect two or more devices together.

### Useful resources

- [Media Queries](https://www.Masterschool.com) - This helped me to better understand the use of media queries for responsive web design. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
